                    <p>1. Find a Good Vet
The first place you and your new puppy should go together is, you guessed it, straight to the vet for a checkup. This visit will not only help ensure that your puppy is healthy and free of serious health issues, birth defects, etc., but it will help you take the first steps toward a good preventive health routine. If you don’t have a vet already, ask friends for recommendations. If you got your dog from a shelter, ask their advice as they may have veterinarians they swear by. Local dog walkers and groomers are also a great source of ideas.</p>
                    <p>2. Make the Most of Your First Vet Visit
Ask your vet which puppy foods he or she recommends, how often to feed, and what portion size to give your pup.</p>
                    <p>3. Shop for Quality Food
Your puppy’s body is growing in critical ways which is why you’ll need to select a food that’s formulated especially for puppies as opposed to adult dogs. Look for a statement from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) on the packaging to ensure that the food you choose will meet your pup’s nutritional requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p>4.  Establish a Bathroom Routine
Because puppies don’t take kindly to wearing diapers, housetraining quickly becomes a high priority on most puppy owners’ list of must-learn tricks. According to the experts, your most potent allies in the quest to housetrain your puppy are patience, planning, and plenty of positive reinforcement. In addition, it’s probably not a bad idea to put a carpet-cleaning battle plan in place, because accidents will happen.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Ways to Dress Up Your Dog</h2>

                    <p>1 Evening Wear
A night on the town requires more than just a bit of fur. If you and your dog are heading out to a special event, don’t forget to get your pal in on the action by dressing them up in their own version of formal wear. Try a sparkly evening dress for the lady dog in your life and male dogs with jackets and ties can complete an evening. In addition, coats and tails are not just for humans as brides and grooms are beginning to pick their favorite dog for the task of their ring bearer or flower girl.</p>
                    <p>Coats and jackets
While most dogs can handle a bit of inclement weather, every dog owner should have cold and wet weather gear handy. However, dog gear doesn’t just have to be about utility. Add a bit of sunshine to your dog’s dreary day with a jacket in a bright, singular color (such as a popular yellow or red) or select a puffy winter coat in a funky pattern. It will be sure to put a smile on others faces as they pass your pet by on your morning walk.</p>
                    <p>Boots and shoes
Just like a jacket and coat, boots are a must when the weather is bad. Not only do they keep your dog from the elements, they also protect delicate paws from dangerous litter and salt. It may take some time for your pup to get used to the weight and the oddness of having a paw covered, but it certainly serves both a stylish and necessary function. Once the dog gets used to a boot, try adding on made-for-dog shoes. From cowboy boots to bunny slippers, your dog’s shoe closet may fill up faster than your own.</p>
                    
                    
     

                    <h2 class="section-heading">5 Ways to Cook for Your Dog on a Tight Budget</h2>

                    <p>These treats and meals will help you get your feet wet in creating K-9 cuisine and help crank up your comfort in making homemade meals for your pooch. After all, when you have control of your dog's meal plan, you're in control of the ingredients—something many pet owners care about these days, given recent pet food recalls. Plus, cooking for your dog ensures your pet eats a diverse menu full of plant nutrients that aren't always readily available in commercial dog foods. "While proteins, vitamins, and minerals provide the base for keeping our bodies going, it's the wider variety of proteins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants in fresh foods that determine the long-term shape of the health of us—and our pets," explains Rick Woodford, author of Feed Your Best Friend Better.</p>
                    <p>CHICKEN STOCK</p>
<p>
While it's never a good idea to feed chicken bones to dogs, you can create a healthy, nourishing broth from a properly prepared chicken carcass. When making this stock for the dogs, you can pack it with flavors and use it as an excuse to clean out the fridge a bit. If you have saved other fruits and vegetables that are still fresh but not likely to be used in the next couple of days, go ahead and add a cup or two. Don't worry so much about precision—you never have to make the same stock twice because you may not be stocking the same ingredients in the fridge. The resulting stock will be rich with flavor, vitamins, and minerals, and can be used to moisten dry food or in any of the cookie recipes. "This recipe not only makes a great addition to the dog bowl, it can be used in the cookie recipe (below) or in your own risotto. No onions needed to flavor this stock," Woodford says.</p>
                    <p>FRESH KISS COOKIES</p>

<p> dogs love us, so they're going to try and kiss us, no matter how much we protest. Get those kisses early, before your dog starts to drool. And make these cookies, which not only will make those kisses more tolerable, but they'll also increase your pet's desire to say thank you. Plus, this recipe will help you use up extra parsley and mint that's left over from your human food.</p>
                    
                    <p>MUTT LOAF</p>

<p>Dnner loaf is free of grain and packed with nutrient-dense veggies. Take off your rings, though, because the best way to mix any good meat loaf is with your hands. Like a friendly mutt, this loaf is a blend of different things. In this case, it's healthy, tasty ingredients that are easy to prepare.</p>
                    <p>SWEET POTATO FRIES FOR SHARING</p>

<p>e's a healthy treat that you and your dog can both enjoy! Even dogs that aren't so sure about vegetables will love this treat. Finish with a little salt and pepper on your portion, to taste. This recipe also works well with yams, parsnips, and turnips.</p>
                    
                    <p>TUNA SANDWICH LEFTOVERS</p>

                    <p> Ofthis dog snack is that you're using leftovers you'd probably toss out otherwise—an inexpensive way to include a little something extra in your dog's food dish. When you're making a tuna fish sandwich, what's the first thing you do? Drain off the water and pour it down the sink. Next, you grab two pieces of bread, being careful to avoid the heel of the loaf. Put these two things you weren't even going to use together and you have a nice little pick-me-up for your pooch.</p>
